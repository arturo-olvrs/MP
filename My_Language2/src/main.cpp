 * @brief This program reads an undefined number of Language objects from the files
 * passed as parameters to main(). It obtains as result the union of all the 
 * input Language objects. The result is then sorted by decreasing order of 
 * frequency and alphabetical order of bigrams when there is any tie in 
 * frequencies. Finally the resulting Language is saved in an output file. The 
 * program must have at least an input file and an output file. 
 * The output Language will have as language identifier, the one of the first
 * file (<file1.bgr>). If an input file <file*.bgr> has a language identifier
 * different from the one of the first file (<file1.bgr>), then it will not
 * be included in the union.
 * Running example:
 * > language2 <file1.bgr> [<file2.bgr> ... <filen.bgr>] <outputFile.bgr>
